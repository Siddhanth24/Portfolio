Welcome to the Bella Beat Project on GitHub! This Folder showcases my analysis of activity, sleep, and health data, where I have created interactive visualizations and uncovered valuable insights from the dataset.

Comprehensive Analysis: The Bella Beat project dives deep into the activity, sleep, and health data to provide a thorough understanding of user behavior and patterns. 

Interactive Visualizations: The project presents interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the data and gain actionable insights. 

Data-Driven Decision-Making: The insights obtained from the analysis empower users to make informed decisions.

Personalized Recommendations: The project goes beyond data analysis by providing personalized recommendations based on individual needs. 
  
Please note that some of the datasets are too large to upload directly to GitHub, as GitHub has a file size limit of 50MB.You can download these datasets from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit. Specifically, the "minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged" table can be found within the link.

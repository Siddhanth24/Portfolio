I have shared my analysis of activity, sleep, and health data with you through this project, I have created interactive visualizations and uncovered valuable insights from the dataset.
  
Please note that some of the datasets are too large to upload directly to GitHub, as GitHub has a file size limit of 50MB. 

You can download these datasets from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit. Specifically, the "minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged" table can be found within the link.
